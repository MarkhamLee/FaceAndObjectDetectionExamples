# Face Detection Examples -- WORK IN PROGRESS 

Basic tutorials/examples depicting the performance, accuracy and other characteristics of a couple of face detection technologies. 


## Plans for future updates
* More details on how the face detection technologies work, including details on the hyperparameters
* Add additional face detection technology examples 
* Show how MTCNN alters the color schemes of the photos "pre whitened tensors" and how you can change them back 
* Benchmarking scripts to quickly test the speed of each face detection option on a particular piece of hardware, as well as accuracy 
* Brief example of how the face detectors can be used as a front-end for facial recognition 


### Update History
* **4/21/2022:** initial commit with examples of facial detection using Haar Cascade with OpenCV and MTCNN, including external helper scripts for the Jupyter Notebook, and sample image files
